## Overview
Our hand tracking software captures all the subtlety and complexity of natural hand movements. It's based on a decade of development and iteration, generations of research in artificial intelligence. We will provide a tool for the user to draw directly on the screen by his/her hand, which will save a lot of time instead of using the mouse to draw.
