## Overview
Our hand tracking software captures all the subtlety and complexity of natural hand movements. It's based on a decade of development and iteration, generations of research in artificial intelligence. We will provide a tool for the user to draw directly on the screen by his/her hand, which will save a lot of time instead of using the mouse to draw.






### Features:
- Detect hand using the camera.
- Detect hand movement. 
- Drawing a shape following the hand.

### Stretch goals:

- Detect the shape of the user drawing and draw the matching shape automatically.

- Erase the drawing (do /undo).

- Choose colors for painting.
